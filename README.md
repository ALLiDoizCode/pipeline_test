# pipeline_test

This Repo is a working example of a ci/cd pipeline for Dapps using motoko built on the Internet Computer

## Convert your identity into a base64

```bash
base64 -i identity.pem
```

### Add your base64 Identity to your repository secrets and name the secrets for each relevant env 
For example DEVELOPEMNT, STAGING and PROD would be the name of your repository secrets and the workflow would access them using secrets.DEVELOPEMNT, secrets.STAGING and secrets.PROD

# Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and building of the project. The CI workflow is triggered on pull requests to the `main`, `master`, and `development` branches.

## Workflow Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. Below is an explanation of the workflow configuration:

### Trigger Events

The workflow is triggered on `pull_request` events targeting the following branches:
- `main`
- `master`
- `development`

### Jobs

The workflow defines a single job named `test` that uses a matrix strategy to run tests in parallel with different versions of Node.js, MOPS, and the Motoko compiler.

### Job Strategy

The job strategy specifies the following:
- **Max Parallel**: 2 (Runs a maximum of 2 jobs in parallel)
- **Matrix**:
  - `moc-version`: [latest]
  - `mops-version`: [ic-mops@latest]
  - `node-version`: [20]

### Job Steps

The job runs on an `ubuntu-latest` runner and includes the following steps:

# Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of the project. The CD workflow is triggered on closed pull requests to the `main`, `master`, `staging`, and `development` branches.

## Workflow Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/cd.yml` file. Below is an explanation of the workflow configuration:

### Trigger Events

The workflow is triggered on `pull_request` events with the `closed` type, targeting the following branches:
- `main`
- `master`
- `staging`
- `development`

### Jobs

The workflow defines a single job named `check-branch` that runs if the pull request is merged. It includes steps for setting up the environment, caching packages, installing dependencies, and deploying to the appropriate network.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll set up a robust CI pipeline that automatically tests your code using the specified matrix of Node.js, MOPS, and Motoko versions aswell as a robust CD pipeline that automatically deploys your code to different environments, ensuring higher reliability and consistency in your deployment process.
